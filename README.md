# ParallelCopy

This is a tiny parallel copy utility I threw together while waiting for a bunch of large sequential copies to complete.
I got this done before the sequential copies finished, finished my copies with it, and then figured it may be useful to others... maybe.

## Building

Super simple, just a `dotnet build` will get you there.

## Usage

```Bash
ParallelCopy [files] <destination>
```
